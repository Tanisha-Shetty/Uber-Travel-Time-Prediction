# Uber-Travel-Time-Prediction
The data for this assessment has been extracted from the dataset Uber Daily Travel
Times 18 Cities 2016-2020 on Kaggle, while the weather data have been extracted from
a London-based weather station dataset on Meteostat.
This dataset contains the mean travel time (in seconds) of Uber rides from the center-
most area in London to all other areas, together with information on weather conditions
(temperature, precipitation and wind speeds) from a weather station in London. Data
are provided for almost 2 years, from 2nd January 2016 to 31st December 2017.
The description of the variables is available below.

Date Date (yyyy-mm-dd)
MeanTravelTimeSeconds Mean travel time (seconds)
tavg Average temperature (°C)
tmin Minimum temperature (°C)
tmax Maximum temperature (°C)
prcp Total precipitation (mm)
windspeed Wind speed (0: low; 1: medium; 2: strong winds)

Split the data into train and test sets. (2) Analyse the training set, plot and produce summary statistics. Check for outliers, missing values and relationships between the variables (3) Fit statistical models to the training data and use them to produce a forecast. (4) Choose the best model based on RMSE scores and other performance metrics.
